# Clasp

## Overview

Here we define some sheet apps script files and their purpose. This is a simple structure for a Google Apps Script project using Clasp.

```
üì¶scripts
‚î£ üìú.clasp.json // Links your local project to the Apps Script project
‚î£ üìúappsscript.json // Defines metadata, access, and web app settings
‚îó üìúmain.js // Contains all your logic (doGet, doPost, onEdit, etc.)
```

Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs the correct **workflow using `clasp`** to make sure your latest code (e.g. with `doPost`) is deployed properly as a web app:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Push local code to Apps Script**

```bash
clasp push
```

This uploads your local `main.js` (and other files like `appsscript.json`) to the Apps Script project.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Create a new deployment**

You need to create a **new version** and deploy it:

```bash
clasp deploy --description "Deploy doPost web app"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This will return a **deployment ID** and a **web app URL** ‚Äî copy that URL and use it for testing.

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Use the correct web app URL**

Once deployed, the correct **public URL** will look like:

```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/<DEPLOYMENT_ID>/exec
```

Use that for your POST/GET requests.

---

### ‚úÖ (Optional) **List all deployments**

If you want to check existing versions:

```bash
clasp deployments
```

---

### ‚úÖ (Optional) **Delete old deployments**

If your script is picking up an outdated version:

```bash
clasp undeploy <deploymentId>
```

---

### üöÄ Summary: Full Working Command Sequence

```bash
clasp push
clasp deploy --description "Updated web app with doPost"
```

Then copy the returned `https://script.google.com/.../exec` and test your POST again.
